Lab 1: Systems Analysis & Design Definitions
Objectives
Define the software development life cycle techniques and deliverables.
Topic
There are many development methods for developing information systems.  The range is from Structured Analysis (waterfall) to Agile methods (SCRUM).    Information Technology experts agree that no single development method is best in all cases.   The system development life cycle describes techniques and deliverables that all systems developers perform,  regardless of, which development method they use to plan, analyze, design, implement, and support an information system.
